# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.0] - Reactive scope and mount stability rules

### Added

- 3 new rules derived from real-world reactive scope bugs
  - 2-9: Never Call Components as Functions (CRITICAL) - JSX/`createComponent()` only; direct calls leak reactive scope
  - 1-7: No Primitives in Reactive Contexts (HIGH) - Don't call hooks or create reactive primitives inside effects/memos
  - 3-6: Stable Component Mount (MEDIUM) - Avoid same component in multiple Switch/Show branches; use CSS for layout changes
- 3 new entries in Common Mistakes table

### Changed

- Rule count updated from 44 to 47
- Components category expanded from 8 to 9 rules
- Reactivity category expanded from 6 to 7 rules
- Control Flow category expanded from 5 to 6 rules
- Updated Code Review task-based selection with new CRITICAL (2-9) and HIGH (1-7) rules
- Updated Writing New Components task-based selection with 2-9

## [1.3.0] - ESLint plugin gap analysis

### Added

- 6 new rules based on [eslint-plugin-solid](https://github.com/solidjs-community/eslint-plugin-solid) gap analysis
  - 2-6: Components Return Once (CRITICAL) - Never use early returns; use `<Show>`, `<Switch>` in JSX
  - 2-7: No React-Specific Props (HIGH) - Use `class` not `className`, `for` not `htmlFor`
  - 2-8: Style Prop Conventions (MEDIUM) - Object syntax with kebab-case and string values
  - 5-5: Avoid innerHTML (HIGH) - Prevent XSS; use JSX or sanitize with DOMPurify
  - 5-6: Event Handler Patterns (MEDIUM) - Delegated vs native events, `on:`/`oncapture:`, array handlers
  - 6-5: Prefer classList (LOW) - Use `classList` prop for conditional class toggling
- Tooling section in SKILL.md recommending `eslint-plugin-solid`
- 5 new entries in Common Mistakes table

- Refs & DOM category expanded from 4 to 6 rules
- Performance category expanded from 4 to 5 rules

## [1.2.0] - Testing category

### Added

- New category 8: Testing, with 6 rules (8-1 through 8-6)
  - 8-1: Configure Vitest for Solid (CRITICAL) - Vitest config with resolve conditions, plugin, deps
  - 8-2: Wrap Render in Arrow Functions (CRITICAL) - `render(() => <C />)` not `render(<C />)`
  - 8-3: Test Primitives in a Root (HIGH) - `createRoot`/`renderHook` for reactive ownership
  - 8-4: Handle Async in Tests (HIGH) - `findBy` queries, fake timer config, portal queries
  - 8-5: Use Accessible Queries (MEDIUM) - Role/label query priority over test IDs
  - 8-6: Separate Logic from UI Tests (MEDIUM) - `renderHook`/`renderDirective` for isolated testing

- Updated README.md features, categories table, and TODO checklist
- Updated AGENTS.md file structure and category list

## [1.1.0] - Skill structure improvements

### Changed

- Fixed SKILL.md frontmatter to use only valid Claude Code fields (`name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`)
- Expanded description with discovery-relevant phrases for better skill activation
- Capitalized tool names to match Claude Code identifiers (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`)
- Merged task-based rule selection, common mistakes table, and React comparison from AGENTS.md into SKILL.md
- Trimmed AGENTS.md to contributor-focused content only
- Added YAML frontmatter (id, title, category, priority, description) to all 32 rule files
